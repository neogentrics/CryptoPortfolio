# CryptoPortfolio 🔐

This repository contains implementations of classic cryptographic ciphers written in C#. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a fundamental understanding of cryptographic principles through code.

## Ciphers Implemented

This project currently includes the following ciphers:

1.  **Caesar Cipher:** A simple substitution cipher where each letter is shifted by a fixed number of positions. It's easily broken but serves as a great introduction to encryption concepts.
2.  **Vigenère Cipher:** A more complex polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to shift letters by different amounts. It was considered unbreakable for centuries.

## How to Run

This is a C# .NET Console Application. To run it:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/neogentrics/CryptoPortfolio.git)
    ```
2.  Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio.
3.  Press `F5` or the "Start" button to build and run the project.

The console will display a demonstration of both the Caesar and Vigenère ciphers encrypting and decrypting sample text.
